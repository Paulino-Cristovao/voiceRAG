## ✅ Verify It's Working

Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
💬 History: X messages  ← NEW! Shows conversation memory is active
```

Test conversation:
```
1. "Quanto custa o Premium 5G?"
   → Should answer: "1.500 MZN/mês"

2. "E qual você recomenda para estudante?"
   → Should recommend a plan (not say "não tenho informação")
   ✅ If this works, upgrade successful!
```

---

## 🔄 Rollback (if needed)

If something goes wrong:
```bash
# Stop new server
# Ctrl+C

# Restore backup
cp app_backup_YYYYMMDD.py app.py

# Restart
python app.py
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Module 'langchain' not found"
```bash
# Solution:
pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-community
```

### Issue 2: Server won't start
```bash
# Check port 8000 is free:
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Restart:
python app.py
```

### Issue 3: "No conversation memory working"
```bash
# Check you're using the right file:
head -5 app.py

# Should see:
# """
# Improved Voice RAG System with LangChain
# - Conversation memory (remembers context)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Test Both Versions Side-by-Side
```bash
# Terminal 1: Original (port 8000)
python app_backup.py

# Terminal 2: LangChain (port 8001)
# Edit app_langchain.py:
# Change: uvicorn.run(app, port=8001)
python app_langchain.py
```

Then test same questions on both:
- http://localhost:8000 (Original)
- http://localhost:8001 (LangChain)
